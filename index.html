		<h3>What is this ?</h3>
		<p>A simple method for aproximating &pi; using some random points.</p>

		<h3>How does it work ?</h3>
		<p>
			I stumbled on this method while surfing youtube <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYQA2ozutTQ">(source)</a>.</p>
		
		<p>
			What we have here is a circle inscribed in a square. The area of the square is A_sqr = Lenght * Length = 4* Radius * Radius;
			While the area of the circle is A_circ = &pi; * Radius * Radius.
			If we divide A_circ/A_sqr = &pi;/4 Or &pi; = 4 * A_circ/A_sqr.
			The next thing to understand is that when we keep generating random points we start filling the Area !!!</p>

		<p>
			It generates random points (x, y) and counts them (Ntotal = total nr. of points generated).
			Each point is checked it hits the circle (Ncirc = points inside the circle).</p>
		
		<p>
			All it's left to do is to calculate &pi; = 4 * A_circ/A_sqr = 4 * Ncirc/Ntotal
